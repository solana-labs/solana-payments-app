              "This is a device or application that stores a collection of keys and can be used to send, receive, and track ownership of cryptocurrencies. “Self-custody” simply means that you and you alone have access to the keypairs of your wallet.",

            question: "Can I use a Coinbase account to receive payments?",

              "Can my settlement wallet and my refund wallet be different?",
            answer:
              "Yes, they can be different! To process refunds, you’ll be required to have a self-custodial wallet that you transact with. You will not be able to process refunds from a Coinbase account. If you are receiving funds to a Coinbase account, then you’ll just need to make sure that when you approve a refund, you are able to send the funds from a self-custodial wallet.",
