# Architecture

Each tier is a SFT, where name, threshold, and discount all form the SFT metadata. When a customer is awarded a tier, they are minted 1 SFT for that tier. When the customer is upgraded to a new tier, their existing SFT is burned, and a new SFT is minted for the new tier.

The tiers themselves are stored in our database for quick reference, and metadatas are created to display data onchain for the customer to view as well.

# Future Plans

We aim to provide more comphrensive data for merchants to see what tiers customers are in.
