# Tiered Discounts

This program allows merchants to setup a tiered discount program where customers are rewarded a discount based on their total spend. For the merchant, they select a threshold spend, a % discount, and a name for the tier. As a merchant, you can update, add, or disable tiers at any time.

For the customer, once they have reached the threshold spend, their total is discounted by the % discount. The customer is also notified if they will be upgraded in tiers, and what their future reward will be.

# Architecture

Each tier is a SFT, where name, threshold, and discount all form the SFT metadata. When a customer is awarded a tier, they are minted 1 SFT for that tier. When the customer is upgraded to a new tier, their existing SFT is burned, and a new SFT is minted for the new tier.

The tiers themselves are stored in our database for quick reference, and metadatas are created to display data onchain for the customer to view as well.

# Future Plans

We aim to provide more comphrensive data for merchants to see what tiers customers are in.
