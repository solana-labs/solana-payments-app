## Install Solana Pay on Shopify

1. Navigate to the [Shopify Solana Pay App Installation Link](https://apps.shopify.com/solana-pay) on the Shopify App Store and click the “Add app” button.

## Configure Solana Pay Portal

### Business information

Follow the KYB steps to submit your documentation. It can take up to 48 hours to be verified by our team.

### Wallet configuration

Enter in your Solana wallet address. This is where you will receive payments from your customers.

#### Non-Custodial Wallet

This type of wallet is a wallet that you own and control (that you own the private keys for). This includes browser wallets like Phantom or Sollet.

#### Custodial Wallet

This type of wallet is often from a provider like Coinbase. Coinbase gives you a single address that only accepts USDC, for example.

Follow [coinbase onboarding steps](./coinbase) to add a coinbase custodial account.

#### Terms and conditions

Review and accept the [Privacy Policy](https://merchant.solanapay.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://merchant.solanapay.com/termsofservice).
