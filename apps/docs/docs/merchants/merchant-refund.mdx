## Create a new refund

Refunds are initiated from your Shopify store admin panel. Log in to [shopify.com](http://shopify.com) and open your Orders page.

Open an order and click the Refund button in the top right:

You can choose how much youâ€™d like to refund. Partial refunds are possible, allowing you to return a portion of the original payment amount to the customer.

## Processing a refund

Refunds are processed on the [Solana Pay merchant portal](https://merchant.solanapay.com). This portal can be accessed from your Shopify store settings by clicking Manage on the Solana Pay payment method.

Refunds are paid using a connected Solana wallet. This wallet does not have to be the same one you receive payments to. If you haven't connected a wallet yet, you'll be prompted to do so when you click the "Approve" button for an open refund request. You'll need to have a Solana wallet installed on your browser to proceed.

Once your wallet is connected, a transaction will be triggered. This transaction sends the refund from your connected wallet to the customer. The process typically takes a few seconds.

## After a Refund is Issued

Once the refund is sent, the order status in Shopify will be updated to reflect that the order has been refunded.

## Denying a Refund

If you wish to deny a refund, you can do so from the Solana Pay merchant portal. Once a refund is denied, it cannot be reissued.

## Notes

-   Refunds might fail if there are insufficient funds in the merchant's Solana wallet.
-   There are small gas fees associated with issuing a refund, which Solana Pay will cover for the time being.
-   The ability to issue a refund is determined by your store's refund policy.
