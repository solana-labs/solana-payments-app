View all your Shop's crypto payments in the [ Merchant Portal Payments page ](https://merchant.solanapay.com/payments) . Each payment is associated with a Shopify order and has a status that indicates its progress:

-   Rejected: The payment was not made.
-   Paid: The payment has been detected on the Solana blockchain by us.
-   Completed: The payment has been paid and acknowledged by Shopify. This status update usually occurs within seconds of payment confirmation.
