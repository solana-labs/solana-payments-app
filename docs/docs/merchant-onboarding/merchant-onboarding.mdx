## Handle Solana Pay refunds

In the Solana Pay merchant portal, [visit the Refunds page](https://merchant.solanapay.com/refunds):

### Create a new refund

Refunds are created from your Shopify store admin panel. Log in to [shopify.com](http://shopify.com) and open your Orders page. 

Open an order and click the Refund button in the top right:

You can choose how much you’d like to refund:

### Processing a refund

Refunds are handled on the [Solana Pay merchant portal](https://merchant.solanapay.com). Remember that you can also get here from your Shopify store settings by clicking Manage on the Solana Pay payment method.

They are paid using a connected Solana wallet. You can use any wallet, it doesn’t have to be the same as the one you receive payments to. 

Click the “Approve” button for an open refund request, and you’ll be asked to connect your Solana wallet.

Once your wallet is connected a transaction will be triggered. This transaction will send the refund from your connected wallet to the customer. 


You can also deny a refund if you’d like to. If you do this then the refund will be closed without a refund being sent.
