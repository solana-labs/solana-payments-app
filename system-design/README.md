# Payments App System Design

This doc should serve as the starting point of the system design for the Solana Payment App.

Note: Given we are in the very early stages of development, this should change over time with the build out.

## Components

- Backend - Orcastration logic that connects merchants to consumers who want to complete a payment over the Solana network
- Mertchant UI - General merchant managment portal
- Payment UI - UI for completing a payment on Solana, lightly coupled to the Solana Payments Appp
- Transaction Request Server - Generalized transaction building engine for payments

## Main Flows

- Payment Flow
- Refund Flow
- Auth Flow

### Payment Flow

The Payment Flow is broken up into three phases.

Phase One: Shopify notifies the payment's app backend of a payment that needs to be made. We will respond with a url that the customer can checkout from.

Phase Two: The customer requests a payment transaction from the backend.

Phase Three: We discover a completed transaction, notify Shopify it's been completed, and send the customer back to Shopify.

```

### Refund Flow

The Refund Flow is broken up into two phases.

Phase One: The merchant initates a refund for a customer. Shoify notifies of of the refund that needs to be proccessed.

Phase Two: The merchant starts the process of completing a pending refund on our merchant-ui.

Phase Three: We discover a completed transaction. Figure out what refund it's for and notify Shopify it's been completed.
